# demo_mapproxy
Demo of MapProxy with UbuntuGIS 16.04

Run mapproxy within a virtualenv withing the docker container. This should
work as an example for running any python app within a virtualenv inside
docker. I've built this demo because I had many questions about using
virtualenv within Docker and answers weren't so easy to find. Hopefully this
should put all the core bits in the one place in an easy to understand manner.
